How does taking the vaccine cause our chances of getting the disease to change? How do diversity policies cause changes in reported discrimination?\nFrom politics to health, economics to science, causation is key. Our lives revolve around causation - yet so many of us do not understand causation.\nWe have all heard of the saying - “correlation is not causation”. But what does that actually mean? How do we go from an observed correlation to finding the causal effect?\nThis booklet aims to teach the fundamentals of causal inference, while relying on as little mathematics and complexity as possible. The goal is that with the knowledge in this booklet, you will be able to critically assess the claims of others - is it truly causation or just correlation? You will also be able to conduct your own causal analysis using the R programming language.",

While I provide the code for the methods, I do not teach how to code in R in this booklet. Thus, if you wish to implement these methods, I recommend looking at simple tutorials regarding coding in R.\nI also provide some more detailed notes in blue drop-down info boxes, for those who are interested in a more thorough approach.",

    "text": "Uncertainty and Inference\nThe estimation process for counterfactuals has a level of uncertainty. We cannot be sure that our estimates are completely accurate. We quantify that uncertainty in our causal effect estimates with a standard error. This value tells us how precise our estimates are:\n\nSmaller standard errors means we are more confident about our estimates.\nLarger standard errors means we are less certain about our estimates.\n\nWith our standard errors, we can calculate how likely that there is zero (no) causal effect (called a p-value). This procedure is called a hypothesis test.\n\nIf our p-value is less than 0.05 (5%), there is less than a 5% chance that there is zero causal effect, which implies 95%+ chance there is a causal effect. In this case, we say there is a statistically significant causal effect.\nIf our p-value is larger than 0.05 (5%), there is a greater than 5% chance that the causal effect is 0. We generally conclude that there is no statistically significant causal effect.\n\nIn most software and reports, if there is a p-value less than 5%, the authors will put stars (**) next to the estimate. If you see any stars, there is statistically significant causal effect.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the figure above, you can see the stars *** indicate a non-zero causal effect.

The answer is no! Our correlation is incorrectly measuring the causal effect because of a confounder.\nA confounder is a third variable that has the following characteristics:\n\nThe confounder is correlated (positive or negative) with the outcome variable.\nThe confounder causes who gets and doesn’t get the treatment.\nThe confounder is not itself caused by the treatment.\n\nIn this example, a confounder could be smoking.\n\nSmoking will worsen health outcomes. Someone who smokes is also more likely to visit the hospital with health complications (getting the treatment)\nThat means people who go to the hospital (get the treatment) start out with (on average) worse health outcomes than people who did not go to the hospital.\n\nThis means that the hospital might actually be boosting people’s health outcomes significantly. But since the people going to the hospital start out with such bad health, even the positive effects of the hospital cannot get their average health outcome to be equal to the people who did not go to the hospital.\nThus, while our correlation says that going to the hospital worsens our health outcomes, the actual causal effect is that going to the hospital boosts our health outcomes.",

But how do these treatment effects compare to correlation? Recall our definition of correlation:\n\\[\n\\text{correlation} = Y_t - Y_c \\ = \\ \\textcolor{purple}{Y_t(1)} - \\textcolor{purple}{Y_c(0)}\n\\]\nNotice how this equation for correlation is not the same to either causal effect we found above. However, if \\(\\textcolor{purple}{Y_c(0)}\\) and \\(\\textcolor{red}{Y_t(0)}\\) are equal, then our correlation would indeed be the same as the causal effect of the treatment group, \\(\\tau_t\\). So are these equal?\n\n\\(\\textcolor{purple}{Y_c(0)}\\) is the potential outcome of group \\(c\\) in the parallel world they do not get the treatment (which we observe)\n\\(\\textcolor{red}{Y_t(0)}\\) is the potential outcome of group \\(t\\) in the parallel world they do not get the treament (which is counterfactual).\nThus, both are the outcome value of all individuals, had they not received the treatment.\n\nSo are these two equal? Not if there is a confounder.\n\nSince the confounder is correlated with the outcome, that means people with different values of the confounder will have different outcomes had they not received the treatment.\nAnd since the confounder affects who gets and does not get the treatment, it might result in the treatment and control groups having different no-treatment potential outcomes.\n\nThus, if there is a confounder, then \\(\\textcolor{purple}{Y_c(0)}\\) and \\(\\textcolor{red}{Y_t(0)}\\) are not equal, and correlation does not equal causation.
