How does taking the vaccine cause our chances of getting the disease to change? How do diversity policies cause changes in reported discrimination?\nFrom politics to health, economics to science, causation is key. Our lives revolve around causation - yet so many of us do not understand causation.\nWe have all heard of the saying - “correlation is not causation”. But what does that actually mean? How do we go from an observed correlation to finding the causal effect?\nThis booklet aims to teach the fundamentals of causal inference, while relying on as little mathematics and complexity as possible. The goal is that with the knowledge in this booklet, you will be able to critically assess the claims of others - is it truly causation or just correlation? You will also be able to conduct your own causal analysis using the R programming language.",

While I provide the code for the methods, I do not teach how to code in R in this booklet. Thus, if you wish to implement these methods, I recommend looking at simple tutorials regarding coding in R.\nI also provide some more detailed notes in blue drop-down info boxes, for those who are interested in a more thorough approach.",

We quantify that uncertainty in our causal effect estimates with a standard error. This value tells us how precise our estimates are:\n\nSmaller standard errors means we are more confident about our estimates.\nLarger standard errors means we are less certain about our estimates.\n\n\n\nNote: the mathematics of calculating standard errors is complex, so we will just trust our computer can do this accurately.\nWith our standard errors, we can calculate how likely that there is zero (no) causal effect (called a p-value).

    "text": "Correlation is not Causation\nWhy is correlation not causation? Imagine this causal question as an example:\n\nHow does going to the hospital to receive treatment affect your health outcomes?\n\nIf we just collect correlation data, we likely find the following:\n\nThe average health outcome of individuals who went to the hospital is low.\nThe average health outcome of individuals who did not go to the hospital is high.\nThus, we find that going to the hospital is correlated with worse health outcomes.\n\nDoes this mean that going to the hospital causes worse health? The answer is no! Our correlation is incorrectly measuring the causal effect because of a confounder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA confounder is a third variable that has the following characteristics:\n\nThe confounder is correlated (positive or negative) with the outcome variable.\nThe confounder causes who gets and doesn’t get the treatment.\nThe confounder is not itself caused by the treatment.\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, a confounder could be smoking.\n\nSmoking will worsen health outcomes. Someone who smokes is also more likely to visit the hospital with health complications.\nThat means people who go to the hospital start out with (on average) worse health outcomes than people who did not go to the hospital.\n\nThis means that the hospital might actually be boosting people’s health outcomes significantly. But since the people going to the hospital start out with such bad health, even the positive effects of the hospital cannot get their average health outcome to be equal to the people who did not go to the hospital.\n\n\nNote: this issue is called selection bias - when people who get the treatment differ from people who do not get the treatment. Then, we cannot tell if the difference in outcomes is due to the treatment, or due to their existing differences.\nThus, while our correlation says that going to the hospital worsens our health outcomes, the actual causal effect is that going to the hospital boosts our health outcomes.",

But how do these treatment effects compare to correlation? Recall our definition of correlation:\n\\[\n\\text{correlation} = \\mean Y_t - \\mean Y_c \\ = \\ \\textcolor{purple}{\\mean Y_T^{(1)}} - \\textcolor{purple}{\\mean Y_C^{(0)}}\n\\]\n\n\nNote: We get this equation from the earlier definition of correlation, and using the table 2.2 to plug in \\(\\mean Y_T\\) and \\(\\mean Y_C\\).\nNotice how this equation for correlation is not the same to either causal effect we found above. However, if \\(\\textcolor{purple}{\\mean Y_C^{(0)}}\\) and \\(\\textcolor{red}{\\mean Y_T^{(0)}}\\) are equal, then our correlation would indeed be the same as the causal effect of the treatment group, \\(\\mean \\tau_T\\). So are these equal?\n\n\\(\\textcolor{purple}{\\mean Y_C^{(0)}}\\) is the potential outcome of group \\(C\\) in the parallel world they do not get the treatment (which we observe)\n\\(\\textcolor{red}{\\mean Y_T^{(0)}}\\) is the potential outcome of group \\(T\\) in the parallel world they do not get the treament (which is counterfactual).\nThus, both are the outcome value of all individuals, had they not received the treatment.\n\nSo are these two equal? Not if there is a confounder.\n\nSince the confounder is correlated with the outcome, that means people with different values of the confounder will have different outcomes had they not received the treatment.\nAnd since the confounder affects who gets and does not get the treatment, it might result in the treatment and control groups having different no-treatment potential outcomes.\n\nThus, if there is a confounder, then \\(\\textcolor{purple}{\\mean Y_C^{(0)}}\\) and \\(\\textcolor{red}{\\mean Y_T^{(0)}}\\) are not equal, and correlation does not equal causation.
