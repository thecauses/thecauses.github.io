# Preface {.unnumbered}

How does raising the minimum wage cause unemployment levels to change? How does going to university cause our career earnings to change? How does taking the vaccine cause our chances of getting the disease to change? From economics to health, politics to physics, causation is key.

We have all heard of the saying - "correlation is not causation". But what does that actually mean? How do we go from an observed correlation to finding the causal effect?

This booklet aims to teach the fundamentals of causal inference, while relying on as little mathematics and complexity as possible. The goal is that with the knowledge in this booklet, you will be able to critically assess the claims of others - is it truly causation or just correlation? You will also be able to conduct your own causal analysis using the R programming language.

## Prerequisites

I aim to avoid as much mathematics and technical notation as possible. I recommend that before starting, one has an understanding of basic statistical concepts, such as average/mean, and some simple high-school level algebra. Some understanding of statistical inference and simple linear regression is desirable but not required.

I provide R-code to implement the methods I discuss in this booklet. While I provide the code for the methods, I do not teach how to code in R in this booklet. Thus, if you wish to implement these methods, I recommend looking at simple tutorials regarding coding in R.

I also provide some more detailed notes in blue drop-down info boxes, for those who are interested in a more thorough approach.

## Layout

This booklet is laid out in the following manner:

-   In the first two chapters, we discuss the basics of causal inference: what is causation, how is it different from correlation, and what are the challenges of finding causal effects.
-   For the remaining main chapters, we discuss different methods to estimate causal effects.
-   In the **appendix: additional topics** section, I also provide other methods that may be used to complement the main methods of causal inference.
